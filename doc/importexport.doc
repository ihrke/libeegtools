\section Using libeegtools with EEGLab/Matlab

 - What is \link http://www.mathworks.com/ MatLab\endlink ?
 - What is \link http://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/ EEGlab\endlink ?

Suppose you imported your data from your recording software into
EEGlab. You want to use libEEGTools functionality that is not well
implemented in Matlab/EEGlab wrappers.

Unfortunately, there is no reader for Matlab .mat files yet (the
format is fairly complicated). It is therefore necessary to
import/export data between libeegtools and matlab.

You have 2 options: 
  -# you implement a custom .mex-file (basically a c-file using the Matlab-API) that connects
  EEGlab to libeegtools (see \ref mexfiles). Have a look at the ml_*.c files in
  /libeegtools/matlab. These are examples for such wrappers.
  -# you export the data you need to libeegtools and import it back to eeglab again (discussed here)

\subsection letlab  EEGlab -> libeegtools

libeegtools implements a reader/writer for a simple \link
rawfileformat RAW-format \endlink that contains ERP-data for a number of
trials and electrodes along with time-marker information. 
To convert an EEG-struct to RAW, do the following:

   -# First you need an epoched EEG-struct that contains the epochs for
\em all \endem experimental conditions (run "Extract Epochs" with all
stimulus-onset markers).
   -# From this struct, extract the indices you want with \ref get_epoch_indices.
   -# run \ref eegset_to_raw to write it to a RAW-file.

\par Example

To write trials from condition 1 and 2 with 2 time-markers
(e.g. stimulus and response) to a file.

\code
matlab> idx = get_epoch_indices( EEG, ['stimulus_onset_condition1' 'stimulus_onset_cond2'] );
matlab> eegset_to_raw( EEG, 2, idx, 'condition1and2.raw');
\endcode
\endpar
