/** \page rawfileformat File Format Raw-Files

 The format is as follows (each segment
 in the table is a 64 bits double):

	  \code
	  1) number of channels
	  2) number of trials
	  3) number of samples per trial segment
	  4) number of markers per trial
	  5) n-doubles giving the times-array (for each sample from 1...n this array
	     gives the corresponding time in ms)
 	  6) num_markers*num_trials-doubles giving markers in samples [1,...,n]
	  7) raw EEG-data in the format of:
	      - channels x trial x samples
			- i.e. first all trials of the first channel one after the other, than
			  the 2nd and so on
	  \endcode	

 It is assumed by the algorithms that only nontrivial markers (unlike 0 and n (sampling points)) 
 are given in the markers-array.
