\section howto How do I ...
 - import and export data? -> \ref importexport
 - use channel-location information? -> \ref chaninfo

\note
See the examples (follow the link on top).

 * \section notes Notes
 * - Functions starting with eeg_*() take an EEGdata - struct as argument 
 *   and the algorithm is carried out independantly for each channel within
 *   the struct.
 * - Functions that start with eegtrials_*() take an EEGdata_trials - struct
 *   as main argument and the algorithm is carried out independantly on the
 *   trial segments (usually the corresponding eeg_*() function is called for
 *   each trial-segment)
 * - Some demo programs are provided in ./progs of the distribution. 
 * - CAUTION: some of the functions are not well tested (alpha). 
 *
 * \section Compilation
 * - You need the GNU Scientific Library >=1.09, available from http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
 * - then compilation and installation according to GNU autotools:
\code
$ tar xvfz libeegtools-ver.tar.gz
$ cd libeegtools-ver.tar.gz
$ ./configure
$ make
$ make install
\endcode
 * 
 * - to install the matlab-files as well, do
\code
$ cd matlab
$ make -f Makefile.matlab
\endcode
 * this will compile the Matlab-Mex-files. You can then use all MATLAB-functions in 
 * this directory from the MATLAB-command line.
 * - after this, you can install the eeglab-plugin by copying all files from ./matlab and 
 *   ./eeglab_plugin to a directory in your eeglab-plugin path.
 *
 * 

\section Acknowledgments
I'd like to thank a couple of people/groups for their code, which they made available under a usable license.
The code I reused from other sources is documented in the source-files at the appropriate places.
- I took a bit of code from the TISEAN 3.1 package (http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean)
   - \ref phspace_estimate_timelag_mutual - \ref nonlinear.h
- I used the code-base of the TIME-FREQUENCY TOOLBOX by Emmanuel Roy and Manuel DAVY (http://www-lagis.univ-lille1.fr/~davy/toolbox/Ctftbeng.html)
   - \ref spectrogram_stft - \ref time_frequency.h
- I included the complete Fidlib-library (and wrote wrappers for the EEG-data) from Jim Peters (http://uazu.net/fidlib/)
   - \ref denoising.h

Thanks Guys!

\par History:
\code
 * $Log$
 * Revision 1.7  2009/05/22 13:37:53  mihrke
 * implemented Fidlib support
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2009/03/31 20:33:18  mihrke
 * fixed many bugs and renamed/restructured a good deal;
 * began ml_padtw which is going to be an essential part of
 * the eeglab plugin
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2009/01/12 11:34:19  mihrke
 * documentation,
 * rearrangements,
 * eeglab
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2008/12/12 13:46:43  mihrke
 * chaninfo etc.
 *

 * Import/Export
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2008/10/17 13:11:32  mihrke
 * a lot of documentation
 *
 * Revision 1.1  2008/10/06 23:19:54  mihrke
 * a lot of stuff...
 * Seems we have 0.2b now :-)
 * New versions of some functions are in t_padtw.c (with a functioname2()-suffix).
 *
 * Revision 1.7  2008/07/31 20:07:53  mihrke
 * evidence for different warping :-)
