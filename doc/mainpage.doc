\section acknowledgements Acknowledgments
I'd like to thank a couple of people/groups for their code, which they made available under a usable license.
The code I reused from other sources is documented in the source-files at the appropriate places.
- I took a bit of code from the TISEAN 3.1 package (http://www.mpipks-dresden.mpg.de/~tisean)
   - \ref phspace_estimate_timelag_mutual - \ref nonlinear.h
- I used the code-base of the TIME-FREQUENCY TOOLBOX by Emmanuel Roy and Manuel DAVY (http://www-lagis.univ-lille1.fr/~davy/toolbox/Ctftbeng.html)
   - \ref spectrogram_stft - \ref time_frequency.h
- I included the complete Fidlib-library (and wrote wrappers for the EEG-data) from Jim Peters (http://uazu.net/fidlib/)
   - \ref filter.h
- I acknowledge the great MATIO (https://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/) library that I use to import Matlab files
- and of course the GNU Scientific Library at http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/

Thanks Guys!
