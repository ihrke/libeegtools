\section dtw General DTW

Generally, DTW is used to compare or transform two curves such that
the difference in temporal
characteristics is minimized. It was developed for 
cases in which there is a general shape in the curves, but they are
differently aligned on the \f$x\f$-axis. 
First, a pointwise dissimilarity measure between two signals \f$s_1,s_2\f$
is defined, such as

\f[
  d(s_2(t_1), s_2(t_2)) := |\tilde{s_1}(t_1) - \tilde{s_2}(t_2)| + |\tilde{s_1}'(t_1) - \tilde{s_2}'(t_2)|
\f]

where \f$\tilde{s}(t) := \frac{s(t) - \langle s(t)
  \rangle_t}{\sqrt{\langle s(t)^2 \rangle_t}}\f$ denotes the
\emph{normalized} signal and \f$s'\f$ is the 
first derivative of \f$s\f$. The data is normalized to find the best 
match regardless of absolute amplitude, since only the temporal
difference between the signals is of interest. The distance used 
here is referred to as derivative DTW because
it considers both amplitude and slope of the signals. 

This measure constitutes the dissimilarity matrix \f$\mathbf{d}_{jk}=d(s_1(j), s_2(k))\f$.
An optimal time-mapping according to the metric chosen above is
produced by finding a path \f$p_i\f$ that is described recursively by
\f[
 \mbox{if } p_i=(j,k) \mbox{ then } p_{i+1} \in \left\{(j+1, k), (j, k+1),
  (j+1, k+1)\right\}
\f]
through \f$\mathbf{d}_{jk}\f$ from the top left to the bottom right
corner that minimizes the sum of the \f$d_{jk}\f$. 

This path can be found by a dynamic programming strategy, computing
the cumulated cost matrix
\f[
D_{jk} = \mathbf{d}_{jk}+\min{\{D_{j,k-1}, D_{j-1,k}, D_{j-1, k-1}\}}
\f]
and backtracking via the minimum of the three neighboring entries (down,
down-right, right) from \f$D_{J,K}\f$ to \f$D_{1,1}\f$.
The final element \f$D_{J,K}\f$ constitutes  a measure for the (dis-)similarity of
the two curves based on their overall shape. Once this path is
available, it is easy to average the curves (called \emph{averaging
  dynamic time-warping}, ADTW) to reduce both temporal
and scale variance by setting
\f[
  ADTW\{s_1,s_2\}(t) = \frac{s_1(j)+s_2(k)}{2},
\f]

where \f$(j,k)= p_t\f$ as introduced in Eq. and \f$t = 1,\ldots,J+K\f$.


For \f$N\f$ trials, a straightforward solution proposed in Picton (1988) is to 
simply combine pairs of single-trial ERPs using ADTW. In a next step, pairs of the
results from this combination can be averaged again and the entire process
iterated until only one average is left. Recursively, 

\f[
  ADTW\{s_1,\ldots,s_{2N}\}(t) = ADTW\{ADTW\{s_1,\ldots,s_{N}\}, ADTW\{s_{N+1},\ldots,s_{2N}\}\}(t)
\f]

with base case from Eq..
